## Ingredients

- `2 cups` (284 g) all-purpose flour
- `2 cups` (200 g) crushed graham cracker crumbs
- `1 teaspoon` baking powder
- `1/4 teaspoon` salt
- `1 cup (227 g)` butter, softened to room temperature
- `1 1/2 cups` (318 g) packed light brown sugar
- `1 teaspoon` vanilla
- `2 large` eggs
- `2 cups` marshmallow topping, like Marshmallow Fluff or Creme
- `2 cups` (340 g) milk or semisweet chocolate chips

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to **350 F**. Line a **9x13-inch pan** with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the 2 short sides. Grease the foil with cooking spray and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the **flour**, **graham cracker crumbs**, **baking powder** and **salt**.
3. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the **butter** and **sugar** until light, about **2 minutes**. Beat in the **eggs** and **vanilla** until well combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the **flour mixture**, mixing until combined.
4. Divide the dough in half. Press half into the bottom of the prepared pan until the dough is evenly flattened. Dollop the **marshmallow topping** on top of the cookie base and gently spread into an even layer. Sprinkle the **chocolate chips** on top.
5. Scatter the remaining dough over the top in clumps. Donâ€™t worry about completely covering the top, the marshmallow and chocolate chips should peek through.
6. Bake the bars until golden brown, about **30-32 minutes**. Cool completely. Remove the bars from the pan using the foil overhangs. Cut into bars and serve.
